/**
 * Maintains a basis factorization across rank-1 basis updates using the **product-form of the inverse**
 * (PFI): a base sparse LU [SparseLu] of the basis `B₀` at the last refactorization, plus a chain of
 * elementary "eta" transforms — one appended per update. [solve] applies the base LU solve and then walks
 * the eta chain in either direction, so an update costs one `O(m)` [update] instead of a full `O(nnz)`
 * refactorization.
 *
 * Each eta records the pivot position `p` (a basis slot) and the spike `η = B⁻¹ A_q` — the entering
 * column transformed by the factorization in effect *just before* the update, i.e. the FTRAN result the
 * caller already computed. After basis slot `p` is replaced by column `q`, the new basis is `B·E` where
 * `E` is the identity with column `p` set to `η`; its inverse differs from the identity only in column
 * `p`, so applying it (and its transpose) is `O(m)` per eta.
 *
 * The chain lengthens fill and accumulates rounding error, so the caller refactorizes once [etaCount]
 * reaches its limit (rebuilding `B₀` and dropping the chain). Spikes are stored densely (length `m`);
 * index spaces match [SparseLu]'s (basis-slot in, original-row out).
